<p><a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> language support for IntelliJ platform.<p>
<p>AsciiDoc is a text document format, similar to formats like Markdown, for writing notes, documentation, articles,
    books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats
    including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page. AsciiDoc is, in contrast to Markdown, highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc
    source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of SGML/XML markup)
    can be customized and extended by the user.

<p>The most advanced and recommended preview mode is JavaFX.
    To use the JavaFX preview instead of the Swing preview, you'll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java and JavaFX
    installed.
    Oracle JDK installations include JavaFX, but can make the IDE unstable and crash.
    Pre-bundled OpenJDK installations usually don't include JavaFX.
    Therefore, JetBrains OpenJDK pre-bundled with your IDE is recommended.

    For better legibility in the JavaFX preview, this package includes DejaVu fonts.
